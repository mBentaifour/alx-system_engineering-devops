a Python script that, using this REST API, for a given employee ID,
returns information about his/her TODO list progress
    > The script must accept an integer as a parameter, which is the employee ID
    > The script must display on the standard output the employee
    > TODO list progress in this exact format:
    > First line: Employee EMPLOYEE_NAME is done with tasks

    which is the sum of completed and non-completed tasks
    ** Second and N next lines display the title of completed tasks:
